He then sees Juliet on her balcony and immediately launches into a series of rapturous comparisons, establishing the play's central light/dark imagery.\n\nHe first metaphorically transforms her into the sun, commanding this \"fair sun\" to replace the \"envious moon,\" which represents the pale, virginal Diana. He urges Juliet to reject this \"vestal livery\" (the chaste, green-sick appearance of the moon) and not to remain a virgin.\n\nHis adoration then focuses on her silent presence, believing her eyes speak volumes he feels he can answer. He imagines her eyes are so bright that two stars have borrowed them, and that their light in the sky would be so brilliant it would fool birds into singing as if it were day. The speech culminates in his intimate, yearning wish to be a glove on her hand so he could touch her cheek.",
