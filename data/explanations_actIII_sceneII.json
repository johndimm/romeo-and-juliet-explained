She imagines lovers can see by their own beauty or love's blindness fits night. She asks night to teach her to lose her virginity modestly and hide her blushing cheeks until love grows bold. She calls Romeo her day within night, whiter than snow on a raven, and fantasizes that after death he will become stars making night so beautiful the world ignores the sun. She feels she has bought love's mansion but not possessed it, and this day is as tedious as a child waiting to wear new robes. She sees the Nurse coming with news, and any word of Romeo is heavenly.",
