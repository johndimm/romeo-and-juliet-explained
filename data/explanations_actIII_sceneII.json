She asks night to teach her to lose her virginity modestly and hide her blushing cheeks until love grows bold. She envisions Romeo as a bright star in the night, making heaven so beautiful that the world would prefer night to day. She feels she has bought love’s mansion but not possessed it, comparing her impatience to a child with new clothes before a festival.",
