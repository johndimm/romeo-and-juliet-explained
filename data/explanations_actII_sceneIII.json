He then explains his task of gathering both poisonous and medicinal plants, reflecting on how the earth provides life and death. This leads to his key philosophical point: even good things can become harmful if misused, and bad things can serve good purposes, foreshadowing how the lovers' pure love will lead to tragedy.",
