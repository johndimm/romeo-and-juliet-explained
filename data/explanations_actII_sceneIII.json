The earth is both a womb and a tomb, producing many different plants, each with its own virtues. Nothing is so evil that it does not give some good to the earth, and nothing so good that it cannot be abused. Virtue becomes vice if misused, and vice can be dignified by proper use. This flower contains both poison and medicine: smelling it revives, tasting it kills. Similarly, humans have grace and base desire; if the worse prevails, death destroys them.",

The sun hasn't yet cleared your sighs from heaven, your old groans still ring in my old ears. Here on your cheek sits the stain of an old tear not yet washed off.
