    "content": "Alone, she expresses dread that they may not meet again. A chilling fear runs through her, nearly stopping her life’s warmth. She considers calling the Nurse back but decides she must face this grim situation alone. Taking the vial, she worries: if the potion fails, she’ll have to marry Paris—but her dagger will prevent that. She fears the Friar may have given her poison to avoid dishonor from her previous marriage to Romeo, but she trusts his holy reputation. She then imagines waking too early in the tomb, suffocating in the airless vault, or going mad from the horror—the stench, shrieks like mandrakes (whose roots were said to drive hearers insane), and the presence of Tybalt’s rotting corpse and ancestors’ bones. In frenzy, she might play with their bones or use one to smash her own skull. She hallucinates Tybalt’s ghost seeking Romeo, then toasts Romeo and drinks the potion. This soliloquy reveals her terror and resolve, heightening suspense before she takes the drug.",
