You have all these in abundance but use none of them properly. Your noble body is just a wax figure, lacking a man's courage; your sworn love is empty perjury, killing the love you vowed to cherish; your intelligence, which should enhance your body and love, is misused in guiding both, like gunpowder in an unskilled soldier's flask set on fire by your own ignorance, and you are destroyed by your own defense. Wake up, man! Your Juliet is alive, for whom you were just now wishing to die—that makes you fortunate. Tybalt would have killed you, but you killed him—that makes you fortunate. The law that threatened death becomes your friend and exiles you instead—that makes you fortunate. A pack of blessings falls on your back; happiness courts you in her finest clothes; but like a misshapen and sulky girl, you reject your fortune and your love. Beware, for such people die miserable. Go to your love as planned, climb to her room, go and comfort her. But do not stay until the watch is set, for then you cannot escape to Mantua, where you will live until we can find a time to announce your marriage, reconcile your families, beg the Prince's pardon, and call you back with infinitely more joy than you left in sorrow.
