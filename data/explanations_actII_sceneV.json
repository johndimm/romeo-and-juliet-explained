    "content": "Juliet anxiously waits for the Nurse, who was supposed to return in half an hour. She worries the Nurse might not have met Romeo, then dismisses that idea, blaming her slowness on age. She reflects that love’s messengers should be as fast as thoughts or doves, but the Nurse is slow like old people, who seem heavy and lifeless. This builds tension and contrasts youthful passion with age’s sluggishness.",
