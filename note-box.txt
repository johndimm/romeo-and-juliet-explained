The note box appears on the right of a speech in the play.  It can be hidden, open and collapsed, or open and expanded.

When it first appears, it is in its collapsed state:

  - note
  - model attribution

The note is hot and a click on it toggles the note box between collapsed and expanded states.

When expanded, it shows:

  - note
  - model attribution
  - instructions on selecting text (visible whenever the note is expanded)
  - chat input box, ask button, More button

The open note box offers three ways to request on-demand explanations.  

  - More
  - Chat Prompt
  - Text Selection (click a word to select sentence, or click-and-drag for custom selection)

Explanation layout:

  - title (Selected Text, More, Chat Prompt)
  - the associated text string.  For More, it is the full speech, like the original note. There is a special rule that the text is not displayed if it is the full speech, to avoid repetition.   Indented, italic.
  - the explanation
  - model attribution
  - garbage can icon

The user can create many explanations for the same speech.  They all appear one after another below the chat input box.

When the note box is collapsed, it returns to its original layout

  - note
  - model attribution

The explanations are hidden in this layout, but are still available.  

At this point, a click on the speech will hide the note box entirely.

When the note box is expanded, clicking on the speech allows text selection (click word to select sentence, or click-and-drag for custom selection).

Later, when the note box is opened again, the explanations will become visible.

A possible layout:

  - note
  - model attribution
  - instructions on selecting text
  - chat input box, ask button, More button

  - More
  - More response

  - Chat Prompt
  - prompt text
  - Chat Prompt response

When the note box is empty, do not show an empty rectangle on screen.

The flow:

  - speech has no note box
  - click on speech to open note box
  - click on speech again to close note box
  - click on open note box to expand it
  - speech allows text selection
  - generate some explanations
  - click on note to collapse the note box
  - explanations are hidden, chat and More are hidden
  - speech no longer allows text selection
  - click on speech to hide note box
