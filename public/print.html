Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ACT I</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE I. A public place.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
No, for then we should be colliers.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
I strike quickly, being moved.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
art moved, thou runn’st away.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and
thrust his maids to the wall.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the
men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
The heads of the maids?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
They must take it in sense that feel it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a
pretty piece of flesh.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.
Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Abram and Balthasar.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
How? Turn thy back and run?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Fear me not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
No, marry; I fear thee!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they bear it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
I do bite my thumb, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Is the law of our side if I say ay?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
No.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
Do you quarrel, sir?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ABRAM.
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ABRAM.
No better.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Well, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Benvolio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>GREGORY.
Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Yes, better, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ABRAM.
You lie.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SAMPSON.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_They fight._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Beats down their swords._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Tybalt.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_They fight._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FIRST CITIZEN.
Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY MONTAGUE.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona’s ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
And Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
 Citizens and Servants._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them, in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY MONTAGUE.
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night.
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
I neither know it nor can learn of him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Have you importun’d him by any means?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
Both by myself and many other friends;
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
Is to himself—I will not say how true—
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
See, where he comes. So please you step aside;
I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Good morrow, cousin.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Is the day so young?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
But new struck nine.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Ay me, sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Not having that which, having, makes them short.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
In love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Out.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Of love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Out of her favour where I am in love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
No coz, I rather weep.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Good heart, at what?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
At thy good heart’s oppression.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Why such is love’s transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Going._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Soft! I will go along:
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O she’s rich in beauty, only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
For beauty starv’d with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O teach me how I should forget to think.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
’Tis the way
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE II. A Street.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
But now my lord, what say you to my suit?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
But saying o’er what I have said before.
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Younger than she are happy mothers made.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
And too soon marr’d are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
And she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love, and you among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparell’d April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SERVANT.
Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to
find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what
names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good
time!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Benvolio and Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.

Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!

Your mother.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
She’s not fourteen.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
A fortnight and odd days.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me. But as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before she broke her brow,
And then my husband,—God be with his soul!
A was a merry man,—took up the child:
‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.
To see now how a jest shall come about.
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:
And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Marry, that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
It is an honour that I dream not of.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers. By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
As all the world—why he’s a man of wax.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
What say you, can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,
And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide.
That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter a Servant.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SERVANT.

A Street.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
 Torch-bearers and others.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
The date is out of such prolixity:
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will,
We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy I will bear the light.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]
A visor for a visor. What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Nay, that’s not so.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
I mean sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But ’tis no wit to go.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Why, may one ask?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I dreamt a dream tonight.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
And so did I.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Well what was yours?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
That dreamers often lie.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she,—</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
Thou talk’st of nothing.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I fear too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night’s revels; and expire the term
Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.

Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor, and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.

By’r Lady, thirty years.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET’S COUSIN.
’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SERVANT.
I know not, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
This by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Why how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Young Romeo, is it?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
’Tis he, that villain Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
A bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
It fits when such a villain is a guest:
I’ll not endure him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
He shall be endur’d.
What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
Am I the master here, or you? Go to.
You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Go to, go to!
You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.
Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.

Shall have the chinks.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
I’ll to my rest.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
The son and heir of old Tiberio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What’s he that now is going out of door?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Marry, that I think be young Petruchio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I know not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Go ask his name. If he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
The only son of your great enemy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
What’s this? What’s this?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
A rhyme I learn’d even now
Of one I danc’d withal.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.

Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE I.

Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
He is wise,
And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Nay, I’ll conjure too.
Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
That were some spite. My invocation
Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
O Romeo, that she were, O that she were
An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Come, shall we go?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Go then; for ’tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Juliet appears above at a window.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Ay me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
She speaks.
O speak again bright angel, for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
So stumblest on my counsel?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
I should adventure for such merchandise.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What shall I swear by?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Do not swear at all.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I’ll believe thee.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
If my heart’s dear love,—</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight;
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say “It lightens.” Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
[_Nurse calls within._]
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Juliet above.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
[_Within._] Madam.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.

I do beseech thee,—</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
[_Within._] Madam.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
By and by I come—
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomorrow will I send.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
So thrive my soul,—</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
A thousand times good night.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Retiring slowly._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Re-enter Juliet, above.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
My dear?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What o’clock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
By the hour of nine.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I would I were thy bird.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels
From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s fiery wheels
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
What is her burying grave, that is her womb:
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find.
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give;
Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,
And vice sometime’s by action dignified.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Good morrow, father.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper’d head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us today.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste.
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
And bad’st me bury love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Not in a grave
To lay one in, another out to have.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I pray thee chide me not, her I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come young waverer, come go with me,
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE IV.

Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so
that he will sure run mad.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
house.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
A challenge, on my life.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Romeo will answer it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter
Tybalt?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Why, what is Tybalt?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of
compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in
your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
The what?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
of accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good
whore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou
fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to
his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to
berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings
and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You
gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as
mine a man may strain courtesy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
in the hams.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Meaning, to curtsy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
A most courteous exposition.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Pink for flower.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Right.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the
wearing, solely singular.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my
whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
goose.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Nay, good goose, bite not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
thee far and wide a broad goose.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as
well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Stop there, stop there.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the
whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Nurse and Peter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Here’s goodly gear!
A sail, a sail!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Peter!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
Anon.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
My fan, Peter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Is it good-den?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
prick of noon.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Out upon you! What a man are you?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him
than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
fault of a worse.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
You say well.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
She will endite him to some supper.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What hast thou found?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[_Sings._]
    An old hare hoar,
    And an old hare hoar,
  Is very good meat in Lent;
    But a hare that is hoar
    Is too much for a score
  When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I will follow you.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
ropery?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak
more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier
than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those
that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of
his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to
use me at his pleasure!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should
quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another
man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy
knave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me
enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first
let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they
say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
gentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with
her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and
very weak dealing.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
thee,—</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will
be a joyful woman.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
gentlemanlike offer.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
Be shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
No truly, sir; not a penny.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Go to; I say you shall.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Now God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a
little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that
would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
Romeo begin both with a letter?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Ay, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins
with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Commend me to thy lady.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Ay, a thousand times. Peter!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit Romeo._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
Anon.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Before and apace.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Juliet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.
O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me.
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Nurse and Peter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Peter, stay at the gate.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit Peter._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I am aweary, give me leave awhile;
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am
out of breath?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though
they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the
flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
No, no. But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? What of that?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Your love says like an honest gentleman,
And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
‘Where is your mother?’</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O God’s lady dear,
Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I have.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church. I must another way,
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
It is enough I may but call her mine.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Juliet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
A lover may bestride the gossamers
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue
Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Conceit more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess,
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ACT III</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE I. A public Place.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no
need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Am I like such a fellow?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
And what to?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel
with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
The fee simple! O simple!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Tybalt and others.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
By my head, here comes the Capulets.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
By my heel, I care not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a
word and a blow.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
occasion.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of
us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s
that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him man.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this: Thou art a villain.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I do protest I never injur’d thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
And so good Capulet, which name I tender

What wouldst thou have with me?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to
make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.

Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,

What, art thou hurt?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.

No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis
enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a
grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both

death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of

I thought all for the best.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MERCUTIO.

This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
With Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Re-enter Benvolio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.

Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Away to heaven respective lenity,
And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>TYBALT.
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.

Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.

Up, sir, go with me.

Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
O noble Prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
Your high displeasure. All this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence.
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Juliet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Nurse, with cords.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Ay, ay, the cords.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Throws them down._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Can heaven be so envious?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.
If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
For who is living, if those two are gone?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
There’s no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Blister’d be thy tongue
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
But O, it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
He made you for a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Friar Lawrence.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
And thou art wedded to calamity.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death. Do not say banishment.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,
And world’s exile is death. Then banished
Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
And turn’d that black word death to banishment.
This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
But Romeo may not. More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
They are free men but I am banished.
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
But banished to kill me? Banished?
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.
Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
To mangle me with that word banished?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O, then I see that mad men have no ears.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Knocking within._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Knocking._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Knocking._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,

Welcome then.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Nurse.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Nurse.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
With blood remov’d but little from her own?
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Drawing his sword._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold thy desperate hand.
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
Romeo is coming.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here.
Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
Farewell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been abed an hour ago.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
But, soft, what day is this?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Monday, my lord.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me, it is so very very late that we
May call it early by and by. Good night.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Romeo and Juliet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
O now be gone, more light and light it grows.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Nurse.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Madam.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Nurse?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
The day is broke, be wary, look about.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Descends._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit below._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Lady Capulet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Why, how now, Juliet?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Madam, I am not well.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What villain, madam?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
That same villain Romeo.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Villain and he be many miles asunder.
God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
That is because the traitor murderer lives.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Capulet and Nurse.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright.
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her.
Out on her, hilding.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
God in heaven bless her.
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
I speak no treason.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
O God ye good-en!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
May not one speak?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
For here we need it not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
You are too hot.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
God’s bread, it makes me mad!
Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match’d, and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself.
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, Nurse.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing
That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the County.
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Speakest thou from thy heart?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
And from my soul too,
Or else beshrew them both.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Amen.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
What?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
To make confession and to be absolv’d.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ACT IV</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Uneven is the course; I like it not.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Juliet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Happily met, my lady and my wife!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
What must be shall be.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s a certain text.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Come you to make confession to this father?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
To answer that, I should confess to you.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Do not deny to him that you love me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I will confess to you that I love him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
God shield I should disturb devotion!—
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exit._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this County.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
Give me some present counsel, or behold
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower,
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
Each part depriv’d of supple government,
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
Then as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come, and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.

How canst thou try them so?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SECOND SERVANT.
Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;

How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Send for the County, go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,

No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.

Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light

What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>JULIET.
No, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.

Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
Nurse!—What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Laying down her dagger._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>What if it be a poison, which the Friar
Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort—
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears,
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Throws herself on the bed._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SCENE IV.

Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!

Ay, let the County take you in your bed,

Ready to go, but never to return.
O son, the night before thy wedding day
Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>LADY CAPULET.
Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
Most miserable hour that e’er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>NURSE.
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.
Most lamentable day, most woeful day
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!

Never was seen so black a day as this.
O woeful day, O woeful day.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PARIS.
Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,
And with my child my joys are buried.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid.
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion,
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
She’s not well married that lives married long,
But she’s best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
And in her best array bear her to church;
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral:
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FIRST MUSICIAN.

Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
You will not then?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FIRST MUSICIAN.
No.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
I will then give it you soundly.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FIRST MUSICIAN.
What will you give us?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FIRST MUSICIAN.

Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>SECOND MUSICIAN.
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>THIRD MUSICIAN.
Faith, I know not what to say.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PETER.
O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is

If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Balthasar.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?

How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
For nothing can be ill if she be well.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BALTHASAR.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
And presently took post to tell it you.
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BALTHASAR.
I do beseech you sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.

No, my good lord.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.

Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
I do remember an apothecary,—
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said,
And if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
What, ho! Apothecary!</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> Enter Apothecary.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>APOTHECARY.
Who calls so loud?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>ROMEO.
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins,
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
As violently as hasty powder fir’d
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>APOTHECARY.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law

Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>APOTHECARY.

Going to find a barefoot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,

Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR JOHN.
I could not send it,—here it is again,—
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR JOHN.

See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
The time and my intents are savage-wild;
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BALTHASAR.

In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre> [_Laying Paris in the monument._]</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>How oft when men are at the point of death

Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous;
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again. Here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.

Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
I married them; and their stol’n marriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
Return’d my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience.
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>BALTHASAR.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not, and left him there.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
Give me the letter, I will look on it.
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PAGE.
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my master drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
Can I demand.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>MONTAGUE.
But I can give thee more,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>CAPULET.
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.</pre></div></div><div class="section"><div class="playText"><pre>PRINCE.
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
For never was a story of more woe

What is the Prince’s doom?\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,\nThat I yet know not?","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nToo familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.","ROMEO.\nWhat less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nA gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,\nNot body’s death, but body’s banishment.","ROMEO.\nHa, banishment? Be merciful, say death;\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\nMuch more than death. Do not say banishment.","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nHence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.","ROMEO.\nThere is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\nHence banished is banish’d from the world,\nAnd world’s exile is death. Then banished\nIs death misterm’d. Calling death banished,\nThou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!\nThy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,\nAnd turn’d that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.","ROMEO.\n’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here\nWhere Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her,\nBut Romeo may not.

They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.\nBut Romeo may not, he is banished.\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly.\nThey are free men but I am banished.\nAnd say’st thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,\nBut banished to kill me? Banished?\nO Friar, the damned use that word in hell.\nHowling attends it. How hast thou the heart,\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,\nTo mangle me with that word banished?","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nThou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,","ROMEO.\nO, thou wilt speak again of banishment.","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nI’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,\nAdversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.","ROMEO.\nYet banished? Hang up philosophy.\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\nDisplant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nO, then I see that mad men have no ears.","ROMEO.\nHow should they, when that wise men have no eyes?","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nLet me dispute with thee of thy estate.","ROMEO.\nThou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\nAnd fall upon the ground as I do now,\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave."," [_Knocking within._]","FRIAR LAWRENCE.\nArise; one knocks.
